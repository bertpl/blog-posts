# 1. Intro

This repo contains some random code snippets related to some blog posts I wrote here: https://brtp.lu/blog/


# 2. Getting Started

- Create a virtual environment:
- Install `requirements.txt`
- Code related to a specific blog post is located in the corresponding `blog/post_nnnn` folder.  To know the post number, check the blog post URL.
  - In case special requirements are needed, also install `requirements.txt` in the `blog/post_nnnn` folder. 
  - Running some of the notebooks will result in creation of figures in the `figures` folder.  These are .gitignored, so will not be committed to the repo.
